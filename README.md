# maze-generator-and-solver
An attempt to make a maze generator and a maze solver.

**Curently as of July 12 2020, only the maze generator works. The solver will be added in the future.**

### Requirements: 
- Python 3.x
- PyGame

## What is This Project?
This project was made as a cool little practice for Python using PyGame

It was created as a demonstration toward trouble shooting issues and problem solving capabilities. 

### Features:
The maze creates a grid of a given size and carves out walls using the recusive backtracking method found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)

When ran, the program should look something like the following:

The user has the ability to change the thickeness, the cell size, the grid size, and now, the delay time.
