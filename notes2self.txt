need to make a list of cells that are on the edge as not to go past the edge
e.g. if top row, don't go to the neighbor in the north, and if east row, don't go to neighbor in the east.

so maybe
    
    for k in range(1,len(grid_size)):
        if k is > 0 and k <= 10
            top_edge.append(grid[k])
        elif k % 10 == 1
            west_edge.append(grid[k])
        elif k % 10 == 0
            east_edge.append(grid[k])
        elif k >= ((SIZE*SIZE) - (SIZE + 1)) and k <= (SIZE * SIZE)
            south_edge.append(grid[k])
